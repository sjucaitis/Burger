# Burger

Eat-Da-Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. 

Eat-Da-Burger is created with MySQL,  Node, Express, Handlebars, and a developer-generated ORM. Node and MySQL query and route data within the application, using Handelbars to generate HTML to the user.

When a user submits a burger name, the application displays the burger to the left of the page. When the burger's "Devour It!" button is clicked, the burger name appears to the right in a list of devoured burgers. All burgers, devoured or not, are saved to the burger database.

To test database, a user must install required node modules and populate a MySql database using the schema and seeds data provided. 

Functionality of the application is demonstrated below.
